# WeddingSeating-CodeChallenge
ByteCubed code challenge.


You work for a wedding planner and are in charge of assigning seating for guests. You are given a list of tables (defined by table name - max capacity). You are also given a list of guest parties, along with the number in that party. Also noted is if a party dislikes one or more other parties. If possible, you should not seat parties at the same table with a party they dislike. If it is not possible to seat all parties at the same table, the program should return an error.
