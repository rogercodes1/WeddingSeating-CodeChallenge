# WeddingSeating-CodeChallenge
ByteCubed code challenge.


You work for a wedding planner and are in charge of assigning seating for guests. You are given a list of tables (defined by table name - max capacity). You are also given a list of guest parties, along with the number in that party. Also noted is if a party dislikes one or more other parties. If possible, you should not seat parties at the same table with a party they dislike. If it is not possible to seat all parties at the same table, the program should return an error.


## Built With

* Ruby
* OOP



# How to Run program

## Installation

On the command line

* gem install ruby
* `ruby run.rb` will run file.


# Notes

* I made the assumption that there would be an input as provided by the first line `tables: A-8 B-8 C-7 D-7`.
* I converted the input lines of guests `"Thornton, party of 3"` and the rest of the list into an array.

* I am assuming that I am receiving all the inputs and then I turn it into an array.
